**Raw file:** `data/raw/employee_data.csv`
**Processed file:** `data/processed/employees_processed.csv`

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did

1. Downloaded the IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset from Kaggle
2. Designed **Employee**, **Department**, and **EmployeeManager** classes
3. Loaded employee data into objects and grouped them by departments
4. Implemented methods for salary calculations and attrition checks
5. Saved a **processed snapshot** with annual salaries to CSV
6. Visualized **salary distribution** (histogram) and **attrition counts** (bar chart) using Matplotlib
7. Wrote small **unit tests** for Employee and Department classes

## ðŸ“Š Next Steps

* Add department-level attrition rate calculations
* Visualize department size and salary averages
* Extend Employee class with promotions and salary updates
* Compare attrition trends over time (if time-series data available)
