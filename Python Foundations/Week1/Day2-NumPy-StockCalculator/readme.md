# Day 2 â€” NumPy Ops: Stock Portfolio Calculator

**Raw file:** data/Portfolio.csv  
**Processed file:** data/Portfolio_processed.csv  

**What I did**
1. Loaded Portfolio.csv (tickers, quantities, close prices, sectors)
2. Converted columns into NumPy arrays
3. Calculated stock values and portfolio total
4. Computed % allocations per stock and per sector
5. Simulated a 10% market drop
6. Saved processed portfolio snapshot

**Next steps**
- Merge with Portfolio_prices.csv to track performance over time
- Compare portfolio vs S&P 500 (SP500.csv)
